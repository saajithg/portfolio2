                <h2>Project 1: Simple Game Development</h2>
                <p>Of the projects, I enjoyed various creations that ranged from simple text-based adventure games to number-guessing games. Simple as they might seem, it really turned out to be one of the best practices, since I learned hands-on how to perform some basic stuff in programming: loops, conditionals, handling user inputâ€”all tools that would become quite essential for any developer. What was exciting about this project was how a few lines of code could make it so engaging; it really made me understand just how much goes into the thoughtfulness of game mechanics. Literally every single game that I built taught me something new, and all of them were not just fun to make but also a rewarding challenge that pushed me to improve my coding skills.</p>

                <h2>Project 2: Learning HTML and CSS</h2>
                <p>First, I needed to learn the basics of HTML and CSS for this portfolio website. Starting with semantic HTML elements such as header, paragraphs, and sections, I practiced creating logical layouts that would make sense not only to the browser but to a user reading the content. Going on to CSS, I got to style the webpage, where I was playing with different color schemes, fonts, and spacing to create something visually appealing. I also used CSS Grid and flex display to provide responsive layouts so that it looked great whether one uses his mobile phone or does work on a desktop. This work truly made me realize the balance in the field of web design between aesthetics and functionality. It was quite satisfying to witness the website come together, and this has given a good ground despite the fact that my advanced projects on web development are far ahead.</p>
